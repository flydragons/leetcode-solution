/**
 * 10. Regular Expression Matching
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/
 *
 * Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression
 * matching with support for '.' and '*'.
 *
 * '.' Matches any single character.
 * '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
 * The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * s could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z.
 * p could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z,
 * and characters like . or *.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input:
 * s = "aa"
 * p = "a"
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input:
 * s = "aa"
 * p = "a*"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the precedeng element, 'a'.
 * Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input:
 * s = "ab"
 * p = ".*"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
 *
 * Example 4:
 *
 * Input:
 * s = "aab"
 * p = "c*a*b"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: c can be repeated 0 times, a can be repeated 1 time.
 * Therefore it matches "aab".
 *
 * Example 5:
 *
 * Input:
 * s = "mississippi"
 * p = "mis*is*p*."
 * Output: false

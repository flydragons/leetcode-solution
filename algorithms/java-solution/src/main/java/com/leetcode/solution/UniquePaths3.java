 * 980. Unique Paths III
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-iii/
 *
 * On a 2-dimensional grid, there are 4 types of squares:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>1 represents the starting square.  There is exactly one starting square.</li>
 *   <li>2 represents the ending square.  There is exactly one ending square.</li>
 *   <li>0 represents empty squares we can walk over.</li>
 *   <li>-1 represents obstacles that we cannot walk over.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the
 * ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.

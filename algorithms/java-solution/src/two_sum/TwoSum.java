/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
 * <p>
 * Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they
 * add up to a specific target.
 * <p>
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may
 * not use the same element twice.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 *     Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
 *
 *     Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
 *     return [0, 1].
 * </pre>
